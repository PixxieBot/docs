# Privacy Policy

This is our "Privacy Policy" which sets out the policy which governs our use of information you provide in connection with the PixxieBot Discord bot. The terms "you" and "your" refer to all individuals or entities with access to Discord servers where PixxieBot is present. The terms "we," "us," "our," refer to PixxieBot and "bot" refers to our Discord bot itself. The terms "user", "member", "channel", "guild" and "server" all refer to those respective Discord features.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes in our Privacy Policy will be effective immediately. By using our websites and/or bot, you consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites, Discord support server or our bot.

### PRIVACY STATEMENT

We respect the privacy of your information. We provide this explanation about our information practices as a show of our commitment to protect your privacy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when using PixxieBot or servers where PixxieBot is present and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.

This policy applies to information we collect:

Via PixxieBot:

* When you interact directly with the bot by running a command (for example: `/daily`).
* When another member of your guild interacts with PixxieBot while mentioning you (for example: `/ship <user>`).
* When you send a message in a channel that has been set up for [Make A Sentence](features/make-a-sentence.md) or Guess The Number games
  * For Make A Sentence we store:
    * The channel ID.
    * The guild ID.
    * The words of the current unfinished sentence.
  * For Guess The Number we store:
    * The channel ID.
    * The guild ID.
    * Your user ID and how many correct guesses you've made.

It does not apply to information collected by:

* us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by PixxieBot or any third party; or
* any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the website (for example, top.gg or other bot listing websites).

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our website or bot. By accessing or using this website/bot, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see [Changes to Our Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md#changes-to-our-privacy-policy)). Your continued use of this website/bot after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

### THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

**Personally Identifiable Information**. At our website, we only collect personally identifiable information from individuals that they provide to us voluntarily. This means we do not require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our website. Our bot only gathers personally identifiable data through interactions with the bot. This information is necessary to make our game features work and helps us provide a better user experience for all PixxieBot users.

The information we always collect when you use a PixxieBot command is:

* Your [Discord ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) (for example: `491002268401926145`).
* Your [Discord tag](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000270351-Custom-Discord-Tags-with-Nitro) (for example: `xtojump`).
* The name and ID of the server where you run a command (for example: `Name: PixxieBot, ID: 675991746856878082`).
* The command you used including any arguments (for example: `/vote reminders`).
* The date and time at which you used the command.

We sometimes also collect:

* User IDs of other users you may have interacted with through a PixxieBot command (for example: `/marry propose <user>` ).

{% hint style="info" %}
To respect your server's privacy, we **NEVER** collect any contents of other messages, only PixxieBot commands and interactions with PixxieBot games in dedicated channels chosen by your admins.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Server admins can limit and choose the channels where PixxieBot will collect this information [by restricting the bot to specific Discord channels](setup/setting-up-the-bot/granting-permissions.md#restricting-pixxiebot-to-one-channel). This will only allow PixxieBot to collect this data in those channels and will make it physically impossible for PixxieBot to collect this data through any other channels in that server.
{% endhint %}

The information we collect when you vote for PixxieBot on third-party website top.gg is:

* Your [Discord ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) (for example: `491002268401926145`).
* The date and time at which you voted for the bot.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**. Through our website, we may automatically collect certain technical information from your computer such as your Internet service provider, your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, the pages viewed, the pages viewed immediately before and after accessing the website, and the search terms entered to get to our site. This information allows us to improve and customise our services. We and our service providers may collect this information using "[cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP\_cookie)" or similar technologies.&#x20;

**Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies**. As you navigate through and interact with our website, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:

* Details of your visits to our website, including traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data, and the resources that you access and use on the website.
* Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type.

We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time (behavioural tracking), however we do not track your activities across third-party websites.

As we do not track activity across third party websites, "do not track" settings are generally not applicable; we do track actions on our website.

The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include personal information. It helps us to improve our website and to deliver a better service, including by enabling us to:

* Estimate our audience size and usage patterns.
* Recognise you when you return to our website.

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

* [**Cookies (or browser cookies)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP\_cookie). You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser.
